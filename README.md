# La Cinémathèque française: logo files

This repo will host the files of La Cinémathèque française's **unofficial** logo.

As a starter, we provide the simplified svg version of the logo in three variants (left, right, center) for use in web pages.

A preview is available here: http://bl.ocks.org/nltesown/1656cc881357c48c5024

## Pure CSS version

Drop **logocf.css** in your css folder and you're good to go (then alter it to suit your needs).The SVG paths are base64-encoded for better compatibility.

The only requirement is to add **width** and **height** properties. The logo will scale to fit in the box while preserving its aspect ratio (1000:400).
